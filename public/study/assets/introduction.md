# Introduction

This is an experiment for CS4804, Data Visualization. We are trying to learn how accurate people are able to analyze different methods of data visualization. For each graph, you will see 2 data points that are marked with a dot. You will be asked to estimate what percentage of the larger data point is the smaller data point. Thank you!
